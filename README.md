# ROS-SF

A Transparent and Efficient ROS Middleware using Serialization-Free Message

To be presented in Middleware 2022 (https://middleware-conf.github.io/2022/)

This work consists of three components: SFM Generator (under `./sfm_gen`), ROS-SF Library (under `./sfm_lib`) and ROS-SF Converter (under `./sfm_conv`).  We provide the source code of all of them in this repository, and we also provide a test workspace for latency test (under `./test_ws`). 

See the README.md in each folder for further information.
