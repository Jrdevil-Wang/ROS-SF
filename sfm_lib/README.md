# ROS-SF Library

The ROS-SF Library consists of two kinds of files.

## Header files

All header (.h) files are used by the headers generated by SFM Generator.
Therefore, they should be placed with ROS headers.
For convenience, we now place them at /opt/ros/$ROS_VERSION$/include/sensor_msgs/

## MemoryMananger.cpp

MemoryManager.cpp should be compiled with the ROS application project.
See /test_ws for an example.
