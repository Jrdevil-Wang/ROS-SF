# Test workspace

A test workspace is placed under the folder `./test_ws` . It is designed based on a [tutorial of ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29).

`pub.cpp` , `sub.cpp`  and `trans.cpp` generate executables `pub`,  `sub`, and `trans` respectively. 

To run experiment in Section5.1:

```
g++ / make
cd 
./pub
# open another terminal
./sub
```



To run e

The evaluation experiment in Section 5.1 of our paper uses `pub` and `sub`, while the experiment in Section 5.2 of our paper uses `pub`, `trans`, and a remapped `sub` (which subscribes to the second topic).



Note that all of them are the converted version with our ROS-SF Converter, but they can be directly used as a ROS application project as well.
The main difference between the ROS version and the ROS-SF version is the header files used during compilation.
If the original ROS headers are used, compilation will generate the ROS version executable; otherwise, if the headers generated by SFM Generator are used, compilation will generate the ROS-SF version executable, and performance improvements can be observed.
