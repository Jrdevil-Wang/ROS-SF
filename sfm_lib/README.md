# ROS-SF Library

To use ROS-SF framework, ROS-SF library needs to be compiled along with the application project. The ROS-SF Library consists of two kinds of files. 

- `*.h` 

  All the  `.h` files are included by the  header files generated by the SFM Generator. Therefore, they should be placed at `/opt/ros/$ROS_VERSION$/include/sensor_msgs/`.

- `MemoryManager.cpp`

  `MemoryManager.cpp` should be compiled with the ROS application project. See `./test_ws` for an example.
